# Cody Evaluation Datasets

This is a collection of datasets for evaluating and benchmarking Cody's performance at code completion.

The actual evaluation script is located [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/cody/-/tree/vscode/test/benchmark). This repository is intended to simply provide a place to store large datasets that aren't suitable to be stored in the main repository.

## Evaluating a dataset

1. Follow instructions in the [Cody repository](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/cody/-/tree/vscode/test/benchmark/README.md)
